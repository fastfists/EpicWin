        Epic Wins was founded in 1940 when an 20 year-old Denzell Epic was fishing with his grandfather.
        One day, while fishing, Denzell’s grandfather entered the lake he was fishing in with a canoe he
        bought at a sporting goods store. The canoe was fragile and in terrible condition, although the
        store advertised it differently. His grandfather obtained an injury that almost cost him his life
        and the sporting goods store found their way out of the legal charges.

        Denzell’s grandmother, Indigo Epic, was horrified at her husband’s injury and the carelessness
        of the sporting goods store. She advised her son Denzell to build his own store, a store that
        would be focused on protection and the customer. Indigo Epic provided Denzell $500 to help fund
        his store, the last bit of money she had left. By the 1980’s, Denzell expanded his products to
        cover not only camping related goods, but also sports, hiking, and footwear.
